    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>A <strong>delicious</strong> quick bread made with ripe bananas and common pantry ingredients. A tender crumb makes
        it hard to put this bread down. Enjoy warm out of the oven, but it's even better the next day.
        Plus optional add-ins, like walnuts, chocolate chips, or even fruit so you can adapt it to your own liking!</p>
